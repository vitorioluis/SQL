/*
DESCRIPTION:
This script will generate a summary report of the stored procedures 
in the current database to show the number of lines of code, the 
number of referenced objects and the number of parameters. These 
metrics can be used to judge the size and the complexity of the 
stored procedure according to the user's own preferences.

The included CASE statement is generic. You can modify its boundary
values that are more granular or write your own statements that look 
at individual factors i.e. the number of code lines, number of 
referenced objects or number of parameters.

The calculation of the number of lines of code can not be standard because 
it depends on the developer's coding style and their use of whitespace.

CHANGE HISTORY:
2012/Dec/01 - Version 1
2013/Feb/15 - Version 1.1 Added the CASE statement for complexity.

INPUT PARAMETERS: 
None

COMPATIBILITY: 
SQL Server version 2008 and later due to use of sys.sql_expression_dependencies

HOW TO USE: 
Select the database and execute the script. It creates and drops one temporary table.
